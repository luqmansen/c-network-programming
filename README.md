# Intro to Network Programming in C
Main reference: [UNIX Network Programming by Richard Stevens](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Network-Programming-Richard-Stevens/dp/0139498761) 


I'm trying to make this repo less baggage as possible (using stlib as much as possible)
so that it's able to run on any unix system (as dockerfile also provided).  

Comment Included in every source code for my own understanding
